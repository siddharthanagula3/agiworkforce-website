# RPA vs Traditional Automation: Which is Right for You in 2025?

Should you invest in enterprise RPA (Robotic Process Automation) or stick with traditional automation tools?

This guide breaks down **every difference** between RPA and traditional automation – costs, capabilities, and real-world use cases.

By the end, you'll know exactly which approach fits your needs.

- Automation Anywhere ($750/month/bot)
- Blue Prism ($15,000+/year)

## What is Traditional Automation?

**Traditional Automation:**
Scripts, macros, and workflows that automate specific tasks.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Uses APIs when available
- Custom scripts or visual builders
- Individual or SMB-focused
- Affordable ($0-$100/month)
- Simple setup

**Major Tools:**
